/*
1. The type names String, Number, and Boolean (starting with capital letters) are legal
     but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code
2.  Always use string, number, or boolean for types.



Array: 
number[]
string[]
primitiveType[]


we can also right this in
Array<numbers>
Array<string>

we will learn about T<U>, when we learn generics
